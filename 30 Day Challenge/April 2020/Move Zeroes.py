# Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

# Example:

# Input: [0, 1, 0, 3, 12]
# Output: [1, 3, 12, 0, 0]

# Note:

#     You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
#     Minimize the total number of operations.
